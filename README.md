# [SOCIALEYES](https://socialeyes-1884ceb59a89.herokuapp.com/)

The aim of the Socialeyes website is to promote events that encourage people of all ages to socialize face to face through their preferred interests or charities to help improve mental health and conquer loneliness. Users will have the ability to register and search for events, view upcoming events and 'like' events they are interested in.

The second aim is to give fundraising events/charities a platform where they can share any events or needs that could help them out for users who may have a little spare time. The event coordinators will have the ability to add, update and delete events, whilst also having the ability to see how many users are 'interested' in the event.

Below you can see the charts I created to visualise the flow of the website and any error messages or actions needed depending on the user interaction. You can see on the charts I have worked out what data needs to be collected or added to the database depending on user interaction and what error messages need to be put in place incase of an unexpected/incorrect response.

## UX

<!-- In this section, you will briefly explain your design processes. -->


### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme of Socialeyes is a mix of contrasting colours which was influenced from the illustration I chose for the homepage. The colours work well together even though they are all completely different colours and this can symbolise the objective of the app, which is to bring different people from different backgrounds together. 
Also, according to colour psychology orange and blue both symbolise social communication, so these are the two I will carry out throughout the colour theme of the website.

- `#000000` used for primary text.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/020644-fa5e2e-ffb540-f4c0b4-0aafa4) to generate my colour palette which was also influnced by the illustration colours.

### Typography


<!-- Explain any fonts and icon libraries used, like Google Fonts and/or Font Awesome.
Consider adding a link to each font used, and the Font Awesome site if used (or similar icon library).

Example:

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer. -->

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials,
however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.
