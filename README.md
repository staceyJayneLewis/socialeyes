# [SOCIALEYES](https://socialeyes-1884ceb59a89.herokuapp.com)

The aim of Socialeyes is to promote events that encourage people of all ages to socialize face to face through their interests/hobbies or charities to help improve mental health and conquer loneliness. Users will have the ability to view upcoming events and 'like' events they are interested in and even add their own event. 

The second aim is to give fundraising events/charities a platform where they can share any events or needs that could help them out for users who may have a little spare time. The event coordinators will have the ability to add, update and delete events, whilst also having the ability to see how many users are 'interested' in the event.

Below you can see the charts I created to visualise the flow of the website and any error messages or actions needed depending on the user interaction. You can see on the charts I have worked out what data needs to be collected or added to the database depending on user interaction and what error messages need to be put in place incase of an unexpected/incorrect response.

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme of Socialeyes is a mix of contrasting colours which was influenced from the illustration I chose for the homepage. The colours work well together even though they are all completely different colours and this can symbolise the objective of the app, which is to bring different people from different backgrounds together. 
Also, according to colour psychology orange and blue both symbolise social communication, so these are the two I will carry out throughout the colour theme of the website.

- `#17268a` used as part of the logo.
- `#000000` used for primary text and logo.
- `#FFFFFF` used for primary highlights.
- `#17268a` used for secondary highlights.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/ffdfdb-f96d4d-17268a-ffb740-000000) to generate my colour palette which was also influnced by the illustration colours.

### Typography

I have used Google fonts to help with the styles of the fonts used in the website.

- [Comfortaa](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Database Design

My project uses a non-relational database with MongoDB, and therefore the database architecture
doesn't have actual relationships like a relational database would.

My database is called **socialeyes**.

It contains 2 collections:

- **events**
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | event_name | String | |
    | event_description | String | |
    | event_date | String | |
    | event_location | String | |
    | event_time | String | |
    | created_by | String | selected from the *users* collection |

- **users**
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | username | String | |
    | password | String | uses Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) |

## Testing

For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://socialeyes-1884ceb59a89.herokuapp.com).

### MongoDB Non-Relational Database

This project uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) for the Non-Relational Database.

To obtain your own MongoDB Database URI, sign-up on their site, then follow these steps:

- The name of the database on MongoDB should be called **insert-your-database-name-here**.
- The collection(s) needed for this database should be **insert-your-collection-names-here**.
- Click on the **Cluster** name created for the project.
- Click on the **Connect** button.
- Click **Connect Your Application**.
- Copy the connection string, and replace `password` with your own password (also remove the angle-brackets).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `IP` | 0.0.0.0 |
| `MONGO_DBNAME` | user's own value |
| `MONGO_URI` | user's own value |
| `PORT` | 5000 |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`
- *replace **app.py** with the name of your primary Flask app name; the one at the root-level*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

If you are using SQLAlchemy for your project, you need to create a local PostgreSQL database.
In this example, the example database name is **db-name**.

```shell
workspace (branch) $ set_pg
workspace (branch) $ psql

... connection to postgres ...

postgres=# CREATE DATABASE db-name;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# \c db-name;
You are now connected to database "db-name" as user "foobar".
db-name=# \q
```

Once that database is created, you must migrate the database changes from your models.py file.
This example uses **app-name** for the name of the primary Flask application.

```shell
workspace (branch) $ python3

... connection to Python CLI ...

>>> from app-name import db
>>> db.create_all()
>>> exit()
```

To confirm that the database table(s) have been created, you can use the following:

```shell
workspace (branch) $ psql -d db-name

... connection to postgres ...

postgres=# \dt

	List of relations
Schema | Name | Type | Owner
-------+------+------+--------
public | blah1 | table | foobar
public | blah2 | table | foobar
public | blah3 | table | foobar

db-name=# \q
```

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps, plus a few extras.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DB_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True")
```

If using Flask-Migrate, make sure to include the following steps as well.

During the course of development, it became necessary to update the PostgreSQL data models.
In order to do this, [Flask-Migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io) was used.

- `pip3 install Flask-Migrate`
- Import the newly installed package on your main `__init__.py` file:
	- `from flask_migrate import Migrate`
- Define **Migrate** in the same file after **app** and **db** are defined:
	- `migrate = Migrate(app, db)`
- Initiate the migration changes in the terminal:

```shell
workspace (branch) $ flask db init

	... generating migrations ...

workspace (branch) $ set_pg
workspace (branch) $ flask db migrate -m "Add a commit message for this migration"

	... migrating changes ...

workspace (branch) $ flask db upgrade

	... updating database ...
```
