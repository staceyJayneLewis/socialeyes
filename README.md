# [SOCIALEYES](HEROKU LINK HERE)

The aim of the Socialeyes website is to promote events that encourage people of all ages to socialize face to face through their preferred interests or charities to help improve mental health and conquer loneliness. Users will have the ability to register and search for events, view upcoming events and 'like' events they are interested in.

The second aim is to give fundraising events/charities a platform where they can share any events or needs that could help them out for users who may have a little spare time. The event coordinators will have the ability to add, update and delete events, whilst also having the ability to see how many users are 'interested' in the event.

### Colour Scheme

<!-- Explain choice of colour scheme -->

- `#000000` used for primary text.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/020644-fa5e2e-ffb540-f4c0b4-0aafa4) to generate my colour palette which was also influnced by the illustration colours.

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.
